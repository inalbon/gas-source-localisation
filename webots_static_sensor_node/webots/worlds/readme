In the world file with multiple robots the odor sensors names should be different, as well as the channels on wich they receive data from the plugin.
So if we have three robots, then sensors should be called (on DEF) SENSOR_ODOR_0, SENSOR_ODOR_1, SENSOR_ODOR_2, listening respectively on channels 0, 1, and 2.
Also, the robots names should be n101, n102, and n103. The numbers would be the IDs.
